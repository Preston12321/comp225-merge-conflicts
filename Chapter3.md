# Chapter 3: Blue, Who?

"Who?"
She is shrouded in mystery.
"Can you hear me"
Who is Blue?
"The Eagle's landing"
She is Magenta's best friend.
"Repeat, Can you hear me"
She is Steve's best friend.
"What? The signal is terrible, someone gonna fix it"
Except then Steve left and Joe came to take his place. 
Joe is okay but not as good as Steve.
Blue loves mail time. 
But Blue cannot talk.
Blue is a dog, so she can only bark.
"That's not true."
When she barks, it sounds like, "bow bow bow bow!", in a sing-songy tone.
Blue loves to solve mysteries with her friend Magenta and her owner Steve/Joe.
Blue is an excellent detective.

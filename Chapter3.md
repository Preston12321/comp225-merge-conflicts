##Chapter 3: Blue, Who?

She is shrouded in mystery.
Who is Blue?
She is Magenta's best friend.
She is Steve's best friend.
Except then Steve left and Joe came to take his place. 
Joe is okay but not as good as Steve.
Blue loves mail time. 
But Blue cannot talk.
Blue is a dog, so she can only bark.
When she barks, it sounds like, "bow bow bow bow!", in a sing-songy tone.
Blue loves to solve mysteries with her friend Magenta and her owner Steve/Joe.
Blue is an excellent detective.

# Chapter 4: Blue Tooth

What makes Blue so special is her blue tooth.
Even she doesn't know the extent of its powers.
Steve had once mentioned how he marveled at Blue's blue tooth.
He claimed that if there was a force strong enough, a connection could be made with the blue tooth.
Blue believes this to be true to some extent.
Sometimes she hears music from her blue tooth.
But for now, the rest remains a mystery.

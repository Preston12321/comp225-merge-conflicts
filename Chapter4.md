# Chapter 4: Blue Tooth

One thing that makes Blue so special is her blue tooth.
Even she doesn't know the extent of its powers.
Steve had once mentioned how he marveled at Blue's blue tooth.
He claimed that if there was a force strong enough, a connection could be made between her blue tooth and other blue teeth.
Blue believes this to be true to some extent.
Sometimes she hears music from her blue tooth, sometimes a random picture pops into her mind.
Steve says this is called Airdrop but Blue does not understand it.
Blue's blue tooth truly is a mystery.

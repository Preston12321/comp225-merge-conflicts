# Chapter 1: Where is Blue?

Attempt 1 Potato Spaceship: A spaceship made from potato, where potators reside. We skipped the chocolate spaceship. No Chocolaters. ERRRRR!

Attempt 2 Pepper shotgun: A shotgun using pepper, big enough to hide something like Blue.

Attempt 3 Cheese Black Hole: we are in the black hole and probably can never come out.

Attempt 4 The blackhole was actually a wormhole to a new universe where all life is modeled after Blue.
